	abstract = {Objectives
To evaluate the force absorption capacity of implant supported restorations utilizing different CAD-CAM materials for the fabrication of crowns and customized abutments.
Methods
80 titanium inserts were scanned to design customized abutments and crowns. The specimens were divided into four groups (n = 20/material): (Z): zirconia, (P): PEEK, (V): VITA Enamic, and (E): IPS e.max. Each group was subdivided into two subgroups according to customized abutment material: (Z) zirconia, and (P) for PEEK. For the assessment of force absorption, all specimens were loaded in a universal testing machine, applied loads curves were collected from the machine’s software, and resulting loads curves were collected from forcemeter below the assembly. The slopes of all curves were analyzed using Two-way multivariate analysis of variance with pairwise comparisons using Tukey Post Hoc test (p {\textless} 0.05).
Results
The curve progression of the applied and resulting forces varied among the investigated materials for each specimen. For zirconia abutments, ZZ showed the highest slope values of the applied and resulting force curves, followed by EZ, VZ, and PZ demonstrating statistically significant differences (P {\textless} .001). As for PEEK abutments, ZP and EP showed the least slope values, followed by PP then VP demonstrating statistically significant differences (P {\textless} .001). For Zirconia and e.max crowns, using PEEK abutments significantly increased slope loss. As for PEEK and Vita Enamic crowns changing abutment material did not significantly affect slope loss.
Significance
Combining rigid crown materials with less rigid abutments might enhance their force absorption capacity. However, with less rigid crown materials a stiff substructure might be mandatory to preserve their force absorption behavior.},

	abstract = {Understanding the effects of weaning on the changes of digestive function could help to design efficient intervention strategies for promoting the development of the  lamb during the early stages of life. In this study, 24 lambs were divided into two  groups (control group, lambs were not weaned; and weaning group, lambs were weaned  at 21 days of age). The growth, nutrient digestion, gastrointestinal enzyme  activity, plasma biochemical indicators, and intestinal microbiota at 7-49 days were  determined, as well as the impact of early weaning. The nutrient digestion changed  rapidly with age, especially at 14-28 days (p {\textless} 0.05). Weaning reduced the dry  matter (DM), crude protein (CP), and ether extract (EE) intake and digestion, but  increased the starch, neutral detergent fiber (NDF), and acid detergent fiber (ADF)  intake and digestion (p {\textless} 0.05). Weaning did not affect the overall jejunal  microbiota (p {\textgreater} 0.05), but affected the relative abundance of certain bacteria taxa  (p {\textless} 0.05). Lactic acid-producing bacteria, such as Olsenella, Bacillus, Sharpea,  and Bifidobacterium are closely related to CP or EE digestion and growth performance  (p {\textless} 0.05). In summary, we delineated the pattern of nutrient digestion and  intestinal microbiota development in young lambs, and the impact of early weaning.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mechanical power (MP) is the energy delivered to the respiratory system over time during mechanical ventilation. Our aim was to compare the currently  available methods to calculate MP during volume- and pressure-controlled  ventilation, comparing different equations with the geometric reference method, to  understand whether the easier to use surrogate formulas were suitable for the  everyday clinical practice. This would warrant a more widespread use of mechanical  power to promote lung protection. METHODS: Forty respiratory failure patients,  sedated and paralyzed for clinical reasons, were ventilated in volume-controlled  ventilation, at two inspiratory flows (30 and 60 L/min), and pressure-controlled  ventilation with a similar tidal volume. Mechanical power was computed both with the  geometric method, as the area between the inspiratory limb of the airway pressure  and the volume, and with two algebraic methods, a comprehensive and a surrogate  formula. RESULTS: The bias between the MP computed by the geometric method and by  the comprehensive algebraic method during volume-controlled ventilation was  respectively 0.053 (0.77, - 0.81) J/min and - 0.4 (0.70, - 1.50) J/min at low and  high flows (r(2) = 0.96 and 0.97, p {\textless} 0.01). The MP measured and computed by the two  methods were highly correlated (r(2) = 0.95 and 0.94, p {\textless} 0.01) with a bias of  - 0.0074 (0.91, - 0.93) and - 1.0 (0.45, - 2.52) J/min at high-low flows. During  pressure-controlled ventilation, the bias between the MP measured and the one  calculated with the comprehensive and simplified methods was correlated  (r(2) = 0.81, 0.94, p {\textless} 0.01) with mean differences of - 0.001 (2.05, - 2.05) and  - 0.81 (2.11, - 0.48) J/min. CONCLUSIONS: Both for volume-controlled and  pressure-controlled ventilation, the surrogate formulas approximate the reference  method well enough to warrant their use in the everyday clinical practice. Given  that these formulas require nothing more than the variables already displayed by the  intensive care ventilator, a more widespread use of mechanical power should be  encouraged to promote lung protection against ventilator-induced lung injury.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: We hypothesized that the ventilator-related causes of lung injury may be unified in a single variable: the mechanical power. We assessed whether the  mechanical power measured by the pressure-volume loops can be computed from its  components: tidal volume (TV)/driving pressure (∆P aw), flow, positive  end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), and respiratory rate (RR). If so, the relative  contributions of each variable to the mechanical power can be estimated. METHODS: We  computed the mechanical power by multiplying each component of the equation of  motion by the variation of volume and RR: [Formula: see text]where ∆V is the tidal  volume, ELrs is the elastance of the respiratory system, I:E is the  inspiratory-to-expiratory time ratio, and R aw is the airway resistance. In 30  patients with normal lungs and in 50 ARDS patients, mechanical power was computed  via the power equation and measured from the dynamic pressure-volume curve at 5 and  15 cmH2O PEEP and 6, 8, 10, and 12 ml/kg TV. We then computed the effects of the  individual component variables on the mechanical power. RESULTS: Computed and  measured mechanical powers were similar at 5 and 15 cmH2O PEEP both in normal  subjects and in ARDS patients (slopes = 0.96, 1.06, 1.01, 1.12 respectively, R  (2) {\textgreater} 0.96 and p {\textless} 0.0001 for all). The mechanical power increases exponentially  with TV, ∆P aw, and flow (exponent = 2) as well as with RR (exponent = 1.4) and  linearly with PEEP. CONCLUSIONS: The mechanical power equation may help estimate the  contribution of the different ventilator-related causes of lung injury and of their  variations. The equation can be easily implemented in every ventilator's software.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mechanical power is a summary variable including all the components which can possibly cause VILI (pressures, volume, flow, respiratory rate). Since the  complexity of its mathematical computation is one of the major factors that delay  its clinical use, we propose here a simple and easy to remember equation to estimate  mechanical power under volume-controlled ventilation: [Formula: see text] where the  mechanical power is expressed in Joules/minute, the minute ventilation (VE) in  liters/minute, the inspiratory flow (F) in liters/minute, and peak pressure and  positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) in centimeter of water. All the components  of this equation are continuously displayed by any ventilator under  volume-controlled ventilation without the need for clinician intervention. To test  the accuracy of this new equation, we compared it with the reference formula of  mechanical power that we proposed for volume-controlled ventilation in the past. The  comparisons were made in a cohort of mechanically ventilated pigs (485 observations)  and in a cohort of ICU patients (265 observations). RESULTS: Both in pigs and in ICU  patients, the correlation between our equation and the reference one was close to  the identity. Indeed, the R(2) ranged from 0.97 to 0.99 and the Bland-Altman showed  small biases (ranging from + 0.35 to - 0.53 J/min) and proportional errors (ranging  from + 0.02 to - 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our new equation of mechanical power for  volume-controlled ventilation represents a simple and accurate alternative to the  more complex ones available to date. This equation does not need any clinical  intervention on the ventilator (such as an inspiratory hold) and could be easily  implemented in the software of any ventilator in volume-controlled mode. This would  allow the clinician to have an estimation of mechanical power at a simple glance and  thus increase the clinical consciousness of this variable which is still far from  being used at the bedside. Our equation carries the same limitations of all other  formulas of mechanical power, the most important of which, as far as it concerns  VILI prevention, are the lack of normalization and its application to the whole  respiratory system (including the chest wall) and not only to the lung parenchyma.},

	abstract = {It has been shown that mechanical ventilation in patients with, or at high-risk for, the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) can be a double-edged  sword. If the mechanical breath is improperly set, it can amplify the lung injury  associated with ARDS, causing a secondary ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI).  Conversely, the mechanical breath can be adjusted to minimize VILI, which can reduce  ARDS mortality. The current standard of care ventilation strategy to minimize VILI  attempts to reduce alveolar over-distension and recruitment-derecruitment (R/D) by  lowering tidal volume (Vt) to 6 cc/kg combined with adjusting positive-end  expiratory pressure (PEEP) based on a sliding scale directed by changes in  oxygenation. Thus, Vt is often but not always set as a "one-size-fits-all" approach  and although PEEP is often set arbitrarily at 5 cmH(2)O, it may be personalized  according to changes in a physiologic parameter, most often to oxygenation. However,  there is evidence that oxygenation as a method to optimize PEEP is not congruent  with the PEEP levels necessary to maintain an open and stable lung. Thus, optimal  PEEP might not be personalized to the lung pathology of an individual patient using  oxygenation as the physiologic feedback system. Multiple methods of personalizing  PEEP have been tested and include dead space, lung compliance, lung stress and  strain, ventilation patterns using computed tomography (CT) or electrical impedance  tomography (EIT), inflection points on the pressure/volume curve (P/V), and the  slope of the expiratory flow curve using airway pressure release ventilation (APRV).  Although many studies have shown that personalizing PEEP is possible, there is no  consensus as to the optimal technique. This review will assess various methods used  to personalize PEEP, directed by physiologic parameters, necessary to adaptively  adjust ventilator settings with progressive changes in lung pathophysiology.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The oxygenation ratio (ie, [Formula: see text]/[Formula: see text]) remains the most commonly used index for assessing oxygenation and disease severity  in patients with acute ARDS. However, the oxygenation ratio does not account for  mechanical ventilation settings. We hypothesized that the oxygenation factor (ie,  oxygenation ratio/mean airway pressure) is superior to the oxygenation ratio in  reflecting oxygenation in patients with ARDS and results in a different  classification of ARDS severity. METHODS: In 150 subjects with ARDS (50 severe, 50  moderate, and 50 mild), arterial blood gas, mean airway pressure, static lung  compliance, driving pressure, and mechanical power were obtained. The oxygenation  ratio and the oxygenation factor were then calculated. Receiver operating  characteristic curves were constructed for oxygenation ratio and oxygenation factor  at lung compliance {\textgreater} 40 mL/cm H(2)O, driving pressure {\textless} 15 cm H(2)O, and mechanical  power {\textless} 17 J/min, thresholds that are known to predict survival in patients with  ARDS. Subjects were reclassified for ARDS severity on the basis of the oxygenation  factor and compared to classification on the basis of the oxygenation ratio.  RESULTS: Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves for the  oxygenation factor were significantly higher than for the oxygenation ratio.  Reclassification of ARDS severity using the oxygenation factor did not affect  subjects classified as having severe ARDS per the oxygenation ratio. However, 52\% of  subjects with moderate ARDS per the oxygenation ratio criteria were reclassified as  either severe (25 subjects) or mild ARDS (1 subject) on the basis of oxygenation  factor criteria. Also, 54\% of subjects with mild ARDS per the oxygenation ratio  criteria were reclassified as severe (4 subjects), moderate (21 subjects), or  non-ARDS (2 subjects) on the basis of oxygenation factor criteria. CONCLUSIONS: The  oxygenation factor was a superior ARDS oxygenation index compared to the oxygenation  ratio and should be considered as a substitute criteria for classification of the  severity of ARDS.

However, for the  same P/F ratio, a patient on a higher positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) may  have more severe lung injury than one on a lower PEEP. OBJECTIVES: We designed a new  formula, the P/FP ratio, incorporating PEEP into the P/F ratio and multiplying with  a correction factor of 10 [(PaO(2)*10)/(FiO(2)*PEEP)], to evaluate if it better  predicts hospital mortality compared to the P/F ratio post-intubation and to assess  the resultant changes in severity classification of ARDS. METHODS: We categorized  patients from a dataset of seven ARDS network trials using the thresholds of ≤ 100  (severe), 101-200 (moderate), and 201-300 (mild) for both P/F (mmHg) and P/FP  (mmHg/cmH(2)O) ratios and evaluated hospital mortality using areas under the  receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC). RESULTS: Out of 3,442 patients,  1,057 (30.7\%) died. The AUC for mortality was higher for the P/FP ratio than the P/F  ratio for PEEP levels {\textgreater} 5 cmH(2)O: 0.710 (95\% CI 0.691-0.730) versus 0.659 (95\% CI  0.637-0.681), P {\textless} 0.001. Improved AUC was seen with increasing PEEP levels; for  PEEP ≥ 18 cmH(2)O: 0.963 (95\% CI 0.947-0.978) versus 0.828 (95\% CI 0.765-0.891),  P {\textless} 0.001. When the P/FP ratio was used instead of the P/F ratio, 12.5\% and 15\% of  patients with moderate and mild ARDS, respectively, were moved to more severe  categories, while 13.9\% and 33.6\% of patients with severe and moderate ARDS,  respectively, were moved to milder categories. The median PEEP and FiO(2) were 14  cmH(2)O and 0.70 for patients reclassified to severe ARDS, and 5 cmH(2)O and 0.40  for patients reclassified to mild ARDS. CONCLUSIONS: The multifactorial P/FP ratio  has a greater predictive validity for hospital mortality in ARDS than the P/F ratio.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The oxygenation index (OI = mean airway pressure, MAP × FiO2 × 100 : PaO2) is used to assess the severity of hypoxic respiratory failure (HRF) and  persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN). An indwelling arterial line  or arterial punctures are necessary to obtain PaO2 for the calculation of OI.  Oxygenation can be continuously and noninvasively assessed using pulse oximetry. The  use of the oxygen saturation index (OSI = MAP × FiO2 × 100 : SpO2) can be an  alternate method of assessing the severity of HRF. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the  correlation between OSI and OI in the following: (1) neonates with HRF and (2) a  lamb model of meconium aspiration syndrome. METHODS: Human neonates: a retrospective  chart review of 74 ventilated late preterm/term neonates with indwelling arterial  access and SpO2 values in the first 24 h of life was conducted. OSI and OI were  calculated and correlated. Lamb model: arterial blood gases were drawn and preductal  SpO2 was documented in 40 term newborn lambs with asphyxia and meconium aspiration.  OI and OSI were calculated and correlated with pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR).  RESULTS: Mean values of OSI and OI showed a correlation coefficient of 0.952 in  neonates (mean value of 308 observations in 74 neonates) and 0.948 in lambs (mean  value of 743 observations in 40 lambs). In lambs, with increasing PVR, there was a  decrease in OI and OSI. CONCLUSION: OSI correlates significantly with OI in infants  with HRF. This noninvasive measure may be used to assess the severity of HRF and  PPHN in neonates without arterial access.},

We hypothesized that the pulse  oximetric saturation (Spo(2))/Fio(2) (S/F) ratio can be substituted for the P/F  ratio in assessing the oxygenation criterion of ALI. METHODS: Corresponding  measurements of Spo(2) (values {\textless}/= 97\%) and Pao(2) from patients enrolled in the  ARDS Network trial of a lower tidal volume ventilator strategy (n = 672) were  compared to determine the relationship between S/F and P/F. S/F threshold values  correlating with P/F ratios of 200 (ARDS) and 300 (ALI) were determined. Similar  measurements from patients enrolled in the ARDS Network trial of lower vs higher  positive end-expiratory pressure (n = 402) were utilized for validation. RESULTS: In  the derivation data set (2,613 measurements), the relationship between S/F and P/F  was described by the following equation: S/F = 64 + 0.84 x (P/F) [p {\textless} 0.0001; r =  0.89). An S/F ratio of 235 corresponded with a P/F ratio of 200, while an S/F ratio  of 315 corresponded with a P/F ratio of 300. The validation database (2,031  measurements) produced a similar linear relationship. The S/F ratio threshold values  of 235 and 315 resulted in 85\% sensitivity with 85\% specificity and 91\% sensitivity  with 56\% specificity, respectively, for P/F ratios of 200 and 300.

Randomized  controlled trials have shown clear benefits of both neuromuscular blockade and prone  positioning in treating moderate to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome, as  defined by the Berlin Criteria. CASE SUMMARY: We present a case of a 53-year-old  patient with a severe coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia who has made a remarkable  recovery following a turbulent period on intensive care. During his stay, he was  prone positioned on 16 consecutive occasions and is an exemplar of the many patients  we treated who benefited considerably from this intervention. CONCLUSION: We believe  that sustained administration of prone position ventilation was instrumental in  saving his life. While there is associated morbidity, we encourage clinicians to  continue with this strategy beyond their normal practice.},

The evolution of  the pathophysiological understanding surrounding the prone position closely follows  the history of ARDS. At the beginning, the focus of the prone position was the  improvement in oxygenation attributed to a perfusion redistribution. However, the  mechanisms behind the prone position are more complex. Indeed, the positive effects  on oxygenation and CO(2) clearance of the prone position are to be ascribed to a  more homogeneous inflation-ventilation, to the lung/thoracic shape mismatch, and to  the change of chest wall elastance. In the past 20 years, five major trials have  tried, starting from different theories, hypotheses, and designs, to demonstrate the  effectiveness of the prone position, which finally found its definitive place among  the different ARDS supportive therapies.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine whether gas exchange improvement in response to the prone position is associated with an improved outcome in acute lung injury (ALI)/acute  respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of patients in  the pronation arm of a controlled randomized trial on prone positioning and patients  enrolled in a previous pilot study of the prone position. SETTING: Twenty-eight  Italian and two Swiss intensive care units. PATIENTS: We studied 225 patients  meeting the criteria for ALI or ARDS. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were in prone position  for 10 days for 6 hrs/day if they met ALI/ARDS criteria when assessed each morning.  Respiratory variables were recorded before and after 6 hrs of pronation with  unchanged ventilatory settings. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We measured arterial  blood gas alterations to the first pronation and the 28-day mortality rate. The  independent risk factors for death in the general population were the Pao2/Fio2  ratio (odds ratio, 0.992; confidence interval, 0.986-0.998), the minute  ventilation/Paco2 ratio (odds ratio, 1.003; confidence interval, 1.000-1.006), and  the concentration of plasma creatinine (odds ratio, 1.385; confidence interval,  1.116-1.720). Pao2 responders (defined as the patients who increased their Pao2/Fio2  by {\textgreater} or =20 mm Hg, 150 patients, mean increase of 100.6 +/- 61.6 mm Hg [13.4 +/- 8.2  kPa]) had an outcome similar to the nonresponders (59 patients, mean decrease -6.3  +/- 23.7 mm Hg [-0.8 +/- 3.2 kPa]; mortality rate 44\% and 46\%, respectively;  relative risk, 1.04; confidence interval, 0.74-1.45, p =.65). The Paco2 responders  (defined as patients whose Paco2 decreased by {\textgreater} or =1 mm Hg, 94 patients, mean  decrease -6.0 +/- 6 mm Hg [-0.8 +/- 0.8 kPa]) had an improved survival when compared  with nonresponders (115 patients, mean increase 6 +/- 6 mm Hg [0.8 +/- 0.8 kPa];  mortality rate 35.1\% and 52.2\%, respectively; relative risk, 1.48; confidence  interval, 1.07-2.05, p =.01). CONCLUSION: ALI/ARDS patients who respond to prone  positioning with reduction of their Paco2 show an increased survival at 28 days.  Improved efficiency of alveolar ventilation (decreased physiologic deadspace ratio)  is an important marker of patients who will survive acute respiratory failure.},

	abstract = {Mechanical power of ventilation, currently defined as the energy delivered from the ventilator to the respiratory system over a period of time, has been recognized as a  promising indicator to evaluate ventilator-induced lung injury and predict the  prognosis of ventilated critically ill patients. Mechanical power can be accurately  measured by the geometric method, while simplified equations allow an easy  estimation of mechanical power at the bedside. There may exist a safety threshold of  mechanical power above which lung injury is inevitable, and the assessment of  mechanical power might be helpful to determine whether the extracorporeal  respiratory support is needed in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome.  It should be noted that relatively low mechanical power does not exclude the  possibility of lung injury. Lung size and inhomogeneity should also be taken into  consideration. Problems regarding the safety limits of mechanical power and  contribution of each component to lung injury have not been determined yet. Whether  mechanical power-directed lung-protective ventilation strategy could improve  clinical outcomes also needs further investigation. Therefore, this review discusses  the algorithms, clinical relevance, optimization, and future directions of  mechanical power in critically ill patients.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Limited data are available on the use of prone position in intubated, invasively ventilated patients with Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). Aim of this  study is to investigate the use and effect of prone position in this population  during the first 2020 pandemic wave. METHODS: Retrospective, multicentre, national  cohort study conducted between February 24 and June 14, 2020, in 24 Italian  Intensive Care Units (ICU) on adult patients needing invasive mechanical ventilation  for respiratory failure caused by COVID-19. Clinical data were collected on the day  of ICU admission. Information regarding the use of prone position was collected  daily. Follow-up for patient outcomes was performed on July 15, 2020. The  respiratory effects of the first prone position were studied in a subset of 78  patients. Patients were classified as Oxygen Responders if the PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio  increased ≥ 20 mmHg during prone position and as Carbon Dioxide Responders if the  ventilatory ratio was reduced during prone position. RESULTS: Of 1057 included  patients, mild, moderate and severe ARDS was present in 15, 50 and 35\% of patients,  respectively, and had a resulting mortality of 25, 33 and 41\%. Prone position was  applied in 61\% of the patients. Patients placed prone had a more severe disease and  died significantly more (45\% vs. 33\%, p {\textless} 0.001). Overall, prone position induced a  significant increase in PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio, while no change in respiratory system  compliance or ventilatory ratio was observed. Seventy-eight \% of the subset of 78  patients were Oxygen Responders. Non-Responders had a more severe respiratory  failure and died more often in the ICU (65\% vs. 38\%, p = 0.047). Forty-seven \% of  patients were defined as Carbon Dioxide Responders. These patients were older and  had more comorbidities; however, no difference in terms of ICU mortality was  observed (51\% vs. 37\%, p = 0.189 for Carbon Dioxide Responders and Non-Responders,  respectively). CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, prone position has been  widely adopted to treat mechanically ventilated patients with respiratory failure.  The majority of patients improved their oxygenation during prone position, most  likely due to a better ventilation perfusion matching. TRIAL REGISTRATION:  clinicaltrials.gov number: NCT04388670.},

This study aimed to characterize the time course of parameters and  outcomes of severe COVID-19 in relation to the timing of liberation from MV. This  retrospective, single-center, observational study was performed using data from  mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU between 1 March 2020  and 15 December 2020. Early liberation from ventilation (EL group) was defined as  successful extubation within 10 days of MV. The trends of respiratory mechanics and  laboratory data were visualized and compared between the EL and prolonged MV (PMV)  groups using smoothing spline and linear mixed effect models. Of 52 admitted  patients, 31 mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients were included (EL group, 20  (69\%); PMV group, 11 (31\%)). The patients' median age was 71 years. While  in-hospital mortality was low (6\%), activities of daily living (ADL) at the time of  hospital discharge were significantly impaired in the PMV group compared to the EL  group (mean Barthel index (range): 30 (7.5-95) versus 2.5 (0-22.5), p = 0.048). The  trends in respiratory compliance were different between patients in the EL and PMV  groups. An increasing trend in the ventilatory ratio during MV until approximately 2  weeks was observed in both groups. The interaction between daily change and earlier  liberation was significant in the trajectory of the thrombin-antithrombin complex,  antithrombin 3, fibrinogen, C-reactive protein, lymphocyte, and positive  end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) values. The indicator of physiological dead space  increases during MV. The trajectory of markers of the hypercoagulation status,  inflammation, and PEEP were significantly different depending on the timing of  liberation from MV. These findings may provide insight into the pathophysiology of  COVID-19 during treatment in the critical care setting.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Measures of oxygenation are traditionally used to monitor the progress of patients on positive pressure ventilation. Although CO2 elimination depends on  fewer variables, measures of CO2 elimination are comparatively overlooked except  when monitoring patients who are difficult to ventilate. CO2 elimination is  dependent upon CO2 production and alveolar ventilation, which together determine  Pa(CO2). Alveolar ventilation is the efficient portion of minute ventilation ('E').  In the clinical setting, problems with CO2 elimination are observed as increasing  Pa(CO2), increasing minute ventilation, or both. In conventional tests of  respiratory function, actual measurements are frequently compared with predicted  measurements. However, this approach has rarely been applied to the measurement of  ventilatory efficiency. METHODS: We have developed a ratio, called the ventilatory  ratio (VR), which compares actual measurements and predicted values of minute  ventilation and Pa(CO2). VR = (V(E measured) x Pa(CO2 measured))/(V(E predicted) x  Pa(CO2 predicted)). V(E predicted) is taken to be 100 (ml kg(-1) min(-1)) based on  predicted body weight, and Pa(CO2 predicted)) is taken to be 5 kPa. RESULTS:  Inspection shows VR to be a unitless ratio that can be easily calculated at the  bedside. VR is governed by carbon dioxide production and ventilatory efficiency in a  logically intuitive way. We suggest that VR provides a simple guide to changes in  ventilatory efficiency. A value close to 1 is predicted for normal individuals and  an increasing value would correspond with worsening ventilation, increased CO2  production, or both. CONCLUSIONS: VR is a new tool providing additional information  for clinicians managing ventilated patients.},

This study focused on providing a better understanding of the prevalence of TN in MS  patients. METHOD: We systematically searched PubMed, Scopus, EMBASE, Web of Science,  and Google Scholar to identify studies published from January 1, 1990, to December  30, 2020. We included studies reporting the TN prevalence among MS patients and  exclude case reports/series and editorial studies, review studies, and non-English  written articles. We used pooled prevalence estimates to determine the TN prevalence  among MS patients. RESULTS: Pooled overall TN prevalence among 19 studies and 30,348  MS patients was estimated as 3.4\% (95\% CI: 1.5\%-5.9\%) with a high level of  heterogeneity among studies (I2=98.92\%; p{\textless}0.001). The pooled prevalence of TN in  male and female patients across 9 surveys was 2.4\% (95\% CI: 0.5\%-5.4\%) and 3.8\% (95\%  CI: 0.8\%-8.7\%), respectively. No heterogeneity between the two groups was observed  (p = 0.558). A meta-regression was performed to explore the source of the  heterogeneity. None of the candidate covariates, including the year of a study  publication, the sample size, the average age of patients, and the disease duration,  were significant in the model. CONCLUSION: Our results showed that TN is a common  problem among patients with MS, predominantly male patients. Future studies should  target the general prevalence of pain in MS patients.},

The objective of this  systematic review with meta-analysis was to determine the effect of medications  compared to placebo in adult patients with TN. METHODS: Review authors identified  randomized placebo-controlled trials (RCTs) from PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane,  and EMBASE up to February 2021. We assessed the inclusion and exclusion criteria as  well as the risk of bias of the studies based on the Cochrane Handbook. A total of  324 unduplicated references were scanned independently and reduced to eight relevant  RCTs, with 89 patients included. Medications investigated included oral  carbamazepine, subcutaneous sumatriptan, lidocaine (intranasal, 8\% spray on the oral  mucosa or intravenous), buprenorphine (ganglionic local opioid analgesia), and oral  Nav1.7, a selective sodium channel blocker. RESULTS: Meta-analyses showed that  overall patients receiving lidocaine reported a significantly lower post-treatment  intensity of pain -3.8 points on a 0-10 scale (95\% Cl = -4.653 to -2.873; P {\textless}  0.001). Patients who received lidocaine were 8.62 times more likely to have pain  improvement than patients on placebo (P {\textless} 0.001). In one RCT, patients receiving  oral carbamazepine showed a significant improvement in pain intensity of -32\%  compared to the placebo (P {\textless} 0.001). In one trial, patients receiving 3 mg  subcutaneous sumatriptan had a significantly lower intensity of pain on average -6.1  points on a scale of 0-10 compared to placebo (P {\textless} 0.001) and a significant  improvement in pain intensity of -75\% compared to the improvement in the placebo  group (P {\textless} 0.001). Patients who received subcutaneous sumatriptan were 10 times more  likely to have pain improvement than those who received placebo (P = 0.001) in one  study. Due to the unclear/high risk of bias and small sample size, the quality of  the evidence for lidocaine in the treatment of TN was low.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Neuropathic facial pain occurs due to pathologic dysfunctions of a nerve responsible for mediating sensory fibers to the head. Surgical interventions, in  cases of failed medical therapy, include microvascular decompression, radiofrequency  (RF) ablation, percutaneous balloon decompression, and stereotactic radiosurgery. In  this review, we focused on RF ablation as a treatment for chronic facial pain.  OBJECTIVES: The objective of this review was to summarize available evidence behind  RF ablation for facial pain, including pain outcome measures, secondary outcomes,  and complications. STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review. SETTING: This systematic review  examined studies that applied the use of RF ablation for management of facial pain.  METHODS: This systematic review was reported following the guidelines outlined in  the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). Two  reviewers independently scored the methodological quality of the selected studies.  Due to heterogeneity of studies, a best-evidence synthesis of the available  prognostic factors was provided. RESULTS: We reviewed 44 studies and assessed their  short- and long-term pain relief measurements, as well as secondary outcomes  including patient satisfaction, quality of life improvements, decrease in oral  medication use, and recurrence rates. Maximal pain relief was achieved in treatment  groups using combined continuous radiofrequency (CRF) and pulsed radiofrequency  (PRF) therapies, followed by CRF therapy alone and finally PRF therapy alone. All  treatment regimens improved secondary outcomes. Common complications of treatment  included facial numbness, masseter weakness, cheek hematomas, diminished corneal  reflex, and dry eyes. LIMITATIONS: A large variability in definitions of trigeminal  neuralgia, RF technique, and patient selection bias was observed in our selected  cohort of studies. In addition, there was a paucity of strong longitudinal  randomized controlled trials and prospective studies. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic  review found evidence that RF ablation is efficient in treating patients with facial  pain, as well as in improving quality of life and reducing oral medication use.  Maximal pain control is achieved using combined CRF and PRF therapy. Complications  are uncommon and include facial numbness, masseter weakness, cheek hematomas,  diminished corneal reflex, and dry eyes.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this article is to systematically review the use, efficacy, differences between botulinum toxin type A doses and side effects of  botulinum toxin type A therapy in patients with trigeminal neuralgia. MATERIAL AND  METHODS: The search for the performed reviews was done in PubMed and Cochrane  library in English language from January 2010 up to February 2020. Inclusion  criteria: full-text studies in English language, in which visual assessment scale  (VAS) was present, in which patients with trigeminal neuralgia (TN) were  participated and the comparison between botulinum toxin type A (BT-A) and saline was  done. RESULTS: The review included 4 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled  trials with 8 to 12 weeks follow-up to observe changes in VAS and in frequency of TN  attacks, differences between dosages of BT-A in therapy and side effects. Mean VAS  of BT-A group decreased by approximately 68\% and of palcebo group decreased by  approximately 21.6\% after the therapy. Mean frequency of TN attacks in 3 studies of  BT-A group decreased by 85\%, while in palcebo by only 15.9\%. CONCLUSIONS: Botulinum  toxin type A injection therapy is a safe and effective method in management of  trigeminal neuralgia. No differences between dosages of botulinum toxin type A were  found. Maximum efficacy was noticed between 6 weeks and 3 months after the  procedure. Side effects were mostly facial asymmetry after injection, headaches,  haematoma, which disappeared in one week.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is a painful disorder characterized by sudden electric shock-like pain. It is a rare condition for which multiple treatments are  available, including medical and surgical. The best treatment option is yet to be  defined, and this is related to the lack of definition in the treatment outcomes and  outcome measures. The aim of this systematic review was to summarize all the  outcomes and outcomes measures that have been published to date and highlight  variability in their use. METHODS: We have conducted a literature search using a  wide range of databases (1946-2019 for medical and 2008-2019 for surgical  treatment), for all intervention studies in TN. Four hundred and sixty-seven studies  were selected for data extraction on TN classification, data collection method,  intervention, and treatment outcomes mapped to the Initiative on Methods,  Measurement, and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials (IMMPACT guidelines). RESULTS:  Most studies collected data on pain (n = 459) and side effects (n = 386) domains;  however, very few collected data on the impact of treatment on physical (n = 46) and  emotional functioning (n = 17) and on patient satisfaction (n = 35). There was high  variability on outcome measures used for pain relief (n = 10), pain intensity (n =  9), and frequency of pain episodes (n = 3). CONCLUSIONS: A clear definition of what  are the important outcomes for patients with TN is essential. The choice of  standardized outcome measures allowing for consistent reporting in TN treatment will  allow for comparison of studies and facilitate treatment choice for patients and  clinicians thus, improving health outcomes and reducing health care cost.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is one of the most common neurological diseases involving the orofacial region. It affects mainly the older population,  usually after the age of 60, and more commonlywomen. It involves the fifth cranial  nerve and manifests as paroxysmal, unilateral, severe, shock-like or knife-like pain  of from a second to two minutes' duration. Usually pain attacks arise spontaneously,  but they can also be precipitated by triggers such as cold weather, brushing teeth  or shaving. The ICHD-3 classification divides TN into classical, secondary and  idiopathic. Current treatment includes pharmacological and surgical methods.  Anticonvulsants, such as carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine, are the first line  therapy. Microvascular decompression is the most common and most effective way to  treat TN surgically. However, none of these methods is free from complications.  Moreover, 25-50\% of patients became refractory to drug therapy. Some studies have  shown that a new therapy that uses a Botulinum toxin type A can be a safe and  effective way to treat trigeminal neuralgia. METHODS: Literature from the PubMed  base and the Main Medical Library from the last 18 years was analysed. Forty-three  items were obtained; after verification, seven articles were included. AIM OF THE  STUDY: To look at current guidelines about treating trigeminal neuralgia with  Botulinum Toxin type A in patients who are refractory to drug therapy or who do not  want to undergo surgical treatment. CONCLUSION: BoNT-A therapy is a safe and  effective method of treating trigeminal neuralgia.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) can have a significant impact on wellbeing and quality of life. Limited data exist for treatments that improve TN pain acutely,  within 24 h of administration. This systematic review aims to identify effective  treatments that acutely relieve TN exacerbations. METHODS: We searched Medline and  Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) for relevant English  language publications. The reference list for all articles was searched for other  relevant publications. All studies that satisfied the following PICO criteria were  included: (i) Population-adults with acute exacerbation of primary TN symptoms; (ii)  Intervention-any medication or intervention with the primary goal of pain relief  within 24 h; (iii) Comparator-usual medical care, placebo, sham or active treatment;  (iv) Outcome-more than 50\% reduction in pain intensity within 24 h of  administration. RESULTS: Of 431 studies, 17 studies were identified that reported  immediate results of acute treatment in TN. The evidence suggests that the following  interventions may be beneficial: local anaesthetic, mainly lidocaine (ophthalmic,  nasal or oral mucosa, trigger point injection, i.v. infusion, nerve block);  anticonvulsant, phenytoin or fosphenytoin (i.v. infusion); serotonin agonist,  sumatriptan (s.c. injection, nasal). Other referenced interventions with very  limited evidence include N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist (magnesium  sulphate infusion) and botulinum toxin (trigger point injection). CONCLUSIONS:  Several treatment options exist that may provide fast and safe relief of TN. Future  studies should report on outcomes within 24 h to improve knowledge of the acute  analgesic TN treatments.},

	abstract = {Percutaneous treatments for trigeminal neuralgia (TN) include glycerol rhizotomy (GR), radiofrequency thermocoagulation (RF), and balloon compression (BC), which aim  to provide pain relief by targeted injury to the trigeminal nerve pain fibers. All  three techniques are well established and can provide immediate pain relief; however  each of them can be associated with a range of complications. Our objective was to  compare the safety and efficacy of GR, RF and BC in patients with TN. This study was  performed according to the PRISMA guidelines. A random effects model meta-analysis  was conducted. Fourteen studies were included. The comparisons of RF vs GR comprised  2,518 patients overall. RF was associated with statistically significant higher odds  of immediate pain relief (OR: 2.65; 95\% CI: 1.29-5.44; I (2):85.5\%) when compared to  GR. Patients in the RF group had a statistically significant higher risk of  anesthesia in the trigeminal distribution (OR: 4.73; 95\% CI: 2.25-9.96; I(2):0\%) and  lower risk for herpes eruption (OR: 0.30; 95\% CI: 0.17-0.56; I(2) :0\%). The  comparison of BC vs GR included 961 patients. Patients in the BC group had a  statistically significant higher risk of mastication weakness (OR: 9.29; 95\% CI:  2.71-31.86; I(2):0\%) and diplopia due to CN IV or CN V palsy (OR: 6.31; 95\% CI:  1.70-23.33; I(2) :0\%) compared to patients in the GR group. The comparisons of BC vs  RF comprised 3,183 patients and did not show significant differences between the two  groups. RF is associated with statistically significant higher odds for immediate  pain relief and anesthesia and lower risk for post-operative herpes eruption as  compared to GR.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The aims of this systematic review are to provide an objective summary of the published literature specific to the treatment of classical trigeminal  neuralgia with stereotactic radiosurgery (RS) and to develop consensus guideline  recommendations for the use of RS, as endorsed by the International Society of  Stereotactic Radiosurgery (ISRS). METHODS: The authors performed a systematic review  of the English-language literature from 1951 up to December 2015 using the Embase,  PubMed, and MEDLINE databases. The following MeSH terms were used in a title and  abstract screening: "radiosurgery" AND "trigeminal." Of the 585 initial results  obtained, the authors performed a full text screening of 185 studies and ultimately  found 65 eligible studies. Guideline recommendations were based on level of evidence  and level of consensus, the latter predefined as at least 85\% agreement among the  ISRS guideline committee members. RESULTS: The results for 65 studies (6461  patients) are reported: 45 Gamma Knife RS (GKS) studies (5687 patients [88\%]), 11  linear accelerator (LINAC) RS studies (511 patients [8\%]), and 9 CyberKnife RS (CKR)  studies (263 patients [4\%]). With the exception of one prospective study, all  studies were retrospective.The mean maximal doses were 71.1-90.1 Gy (prescribed at  the 100\% isodose line) for GKS, 83.3 Gy for LINAC, and 64.3-80.5 Gy for CKR (the  latter two prescribed at the 80\% or 90\% isodose lines, respectively). The ranges of  maximal doses were as follows: 60-97 Gy for GKS, 50-90 Gy for LINAC, and 66-90 Gy  for CKR.Actuarial initial freedom from pain (FFP) without medication ranged from  28.6\% to 100\% (mean 53.1\%, median 52.1\%) for GKS, from 17.3\% to 76\% (mean 49.3\%,  median 43.2\%) for LINAC, and from 40\% to 72\% (mean 56.3\%, median 58\%) for CKR.  Specific to hypesthesia, the crude rates (all Barrow Neurological Institute Pain  Intensity Scale scores included) ranged from 0\% to 68.8\% (mean 21.7\%, median 19\%)  for GKS, from 11.4\% to 49.7\% (mean 27.6\%, median 28.5\%) for LINAC, and from 11.8\% to  51.2\% (mean 29.1\%, median 18.7\%) for CKR. Other complications included dysesthesias,  paresthesias, dry eye, deafferentation pain, and keratitis. Hypesthesia and  paresthesia occurred as complications only when the anterior retrogasserian portion  of the trigeminal nerve was targeted, whereas the other listed complications  occurred when the root entry zone was targeted. Recurrence rates ranged from 0\% to  52.2\% (mean 24.6\%, median 23\%) for GKS, from 19\% to 63\% (mean 32.2\%, median 29\%) for  LINAC, and from 15.8\% to 33\% (mean 25.8\%, median 27.2\%) for CKR. Two GKS series  reported 30\% and 45.3\% of patients who were pain free without medication at 10  years. CONCLUSIONS: The literature is limited in its level of evidence, with only  one comparative randomized trial (1 vs 2 isocenters) reported to date. At present,  one can conclude that RS is a safe and effective therapy for drug-resistant  trigeminal neuralgia. A number of consensus statements have been made and endorsed  by the ISRS.},

However,  there is little evidence that such treatments result in 50\% pain reduction and  improvement in quality of life. The aim of this systematic review is to evaluate the  clinical effectiveness of treatments in patients with MS and trigeminal neuralgia.  METHODS: We searched Medline, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Collaboration database from  inception until October 2016. Two authors independently selected studies for  inclusions, data extraction, and bias assessment. RESULTS: All studies were of low  quality using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and  Evaluation) system. For medical management, 10 studies were included, of which one  was a randomized controlled trial. Two studies were on the use of misopropol, unique  to patients with MS. For surgical therapy, 26 studies with at least 10 patients and  a minimum of 2 years follow-up were included. All types of surgical procedures are  reported and the results are poorer for TN with MS, with 50\% having a recurrence by  2 years. The main complication was sensory loss. Many patients had to undergo  further procedures to become pain free and there were no agreed prognostic factors.  CONCLUSIONS: There was insufficient evidence to support any 1 medical therapy and so  earlier surgery may be preferable. A patient with TN and MS has therefore to make a  decision based on low-level evidence, beginning with standard drug therapy and then  choosing a surgical procedure.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Several anticonvulsant drugs are used in the management of neuropathic pain. Oxcarbazepine is an anticonvulsant drug closely related to carbamazepine.  Oxcarbazepine has been reported to be efficacious in the treatment of neuropathic  pain, but evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) is conflicting.  Oxcarbazepine is reportedly better tolerated than carbamazepine. This is the first  update of a review published in 2013. OBJECTIVES: To assess the benefits and harms  of oxcarbazepine for different types of neuropathic pain. SEARCH METHODS: On 21  November 2016, we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, CENTRAL,  MEDLINE and Embase. We searched the Chinese Biomedical Retrieval System (January  1978 to November 2016). We searched the US National Institutes of Health (NIH)  databases and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials  Registry Platform for ongoing trials in January 2017, and we wrote to the companies  who make oxcarbazepine and to pain experts requesting additional information.  SELECTION CRITERIA: All RCTs and randomised cross-over studies of oxcarbazepine for  the treatment of people of any age or sex with any neuropathic pain were eligible.  We planned to include trials of oxcarbazepine compared with placebo or any other  intervention with a treatment duration of at least six weeks, regardless of  administration route and dose. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard  methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. MAIN RESULTS: Five multicentre,  randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind trials with a total of 862 participants  were eligible for inclusion in this updated review. Three trials involved  participants with painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) (n = 634), one  included people with neuropathic pain due to radiculopathy (n = 145), and one, which  was newly identified at this update, involved participants with peripheral  neuropathic pain of mixed origin (polyneuropathy, peripheral nerve injury or  postherpetic neuralgia) (n = 83). Some studies did not report all outcomes of  interest. For painful DPN, compared to the baseline, the proportion of participants  who reported at least a 50\% or 30\% reduction of pain scores after 16 weeks of  treatment in the oxcarbazepine group versus the placebo group were: at least 50\%  reduction: 34.8\% with oxcarbazepine versus 18.2\% with placebo (risk ratio (RR) 1.91,  95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.08 to 3.39, number of people needed to treat for an  additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 6, 95\% CI 3 to 41); and at least 30\% reduction:  44.9\% with oxcarbazepine versus 28.6\% with placebo (RR 1.57, 95\% CI 1.01 to 2.44;  NNTB 6, 95\% CI 3 to 114; n = 146). Both results were based on data from a single  trial, since two trials that found little or no benefit did not provide data that  could be included in a meta-analysis. Although these trials were well designed,  incomplete outcome data and possible unblinding of participants due to obvious  adverse effects placed the results at a high risk of bias. There was also serious  imprecision and a high risk of publication bias. The radiculopathy trial reported no  benefit for the outcome 'at least 50\% pain relief' from oxcarbazepine. In mixed  neuropathies, 19.3\% of people receiving oxcarbazepine versus 4.8\% receiving placebo  had at least 50\% pain relief. These small trials had low event rates and provided,  at best, low-quality evidence for any outcome. The proportion of people with  'improved' or 'very much improved' pain was 45.9\% with oxcarbazepine versus 30.1\%  with placebo in DPN (RR 1.46, 95\% CI 1.13 to 1.88; n = 493; 2 trials;  very-low-quality evidence) and 23.9\% with oxcarbazepine versus 14.9\% with placebo in  radiculopathy (RR 1.61, 95\% CI 0.81 to 3.20; n = 145).We found no trials in other  types of neuropathic pain such as trigeminal neuralgia.Trial reports stated that  most adverse effects were mild to moderate in severity. Based on moderate-quality  evidence from the three DPN trials, serious adverse effects occurred in 8.3\% with  oxcarbazepine and 2.5\% with placebo (RR 3.65, 95\% CI 1.45 to 9.20; n = 634;  moderate-quality evidence). The number needed to treat for an additional harmful  (serious adverse effect) outcome (NNTH) was 17 (95\% CI 11 to 42). The RR for serious  adverse effects in the radiculopathy trial was 3.13 (95\% CI 0.65 to 14.98, n = 145).  The fifth trial did not provide data.More people withdrew because of adverse effects  with oxcarbazepine than with placebo (DPN: 25.6\% with oxcarbazepine versus 6.8\% with  placebo; RR 3.83, 95\% CI 2.29 to 6.40; radiculopathy: 42.3\% with oxcarbazepine  versus 14.9\% with placebo; RR 2.84, 95\% CI 1.55 to 5.23; mixed neuropathic pain:  13.5\% with oxcarbazepine versus 1.2\% with placebo; RR 11.51, 95\% CI 1.54 to 86.15).  AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: This review found little evidence to support the effectiveness  of oxcarbazepine in painful diabetic neuropathy, neuropathic pain from radiculopathy  and a mixture of neuropathies. Some very-low-quality evidence suggests efficacy but  small trials, low event rates, heterogeneity in some measures and a high risk of  publication bias means that we have very low confidence in the measures of effect.  Adverse effects, serious adverse effects and adverse effects leading to  discontinuation are probably more common with oxcarbazepine than placebo; however,  the numbers of participants and event rates are low. More well-designed, multicentre  RCTs investigating oxcarbazepine for various types of neuropathic pain are needed,  and selective publication of studies or data should be avoided.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Traditional approaches to mechanical ventilation use tidal volumes of 10 to 15 ml per kilogram of body weight and may cause stretch-induced lung injury in  patients with acute lung injury and the acute respiratory distress syndrome. We  therefore conducted a trial to determine whether ventilation with lower tidal  volumes would improve the clinical outcomes in these patients. METHODS: Patients  with acute lung injury and the acute respiratory distress syndrome were enrolled in  a multicenter, randomized trial. The trial compared traditional ventilation  treatment, which involved an initial tidal volume of 12 ml per kilogram of predicted  body weight and an airway pressure measured after a 0.5-second pause at the end of  inspiration (plateau pressure) of 50 cm of water or less, with ventilation with a  lower tidal volume, which involved an initial tidal volume of 6 ml per kilogram of  predicted body weight and a plateau pressure of 30 cm of water or less. The primary  outcomes were death before a patient was discharged home and was breathing without  assistance and the number of days without ventilator use from day 1 to day 28.  RESULTS: The trial was stopped after the enrollment of 861 patients because  mortality was lower in the group treated with lower tidal volumes than in the group  treated with traditional tidal volumes (31.0 percent vs. 39.8 percent, P=0.007), and  the number of days without ventilator use during the first 28 days after  randomization was greater in this group (mean [+/-SD], 12+/-11 vs. 10+/-11;  P=0.007). The mean tidal volumes on days 1 to 3 were 6.2+/-0.8 and 11.8+/-0.8 ml per  kilogram of predicted body weight (P{\textless}0.001), respectively, and the mean plateau  pressures were 25+/-6 and 33+/-8 cm of water (P{\textless}0.001), respectively. CONCLUSIONS:  In patients with acute lung injury and the acute respiratory distress syndrome,  mechanical ventilation with a lower tidal volume than is traditionally used results  in decreased mortality and increases the number of days without ventilator use.},

	abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVES: To assess the reliability of new and traditional oxygenation measurements in reflecting intrapulmonary shunt. DESIGN: Prospective study. SETTING:  Cardiac surgery unit at a university hospital. PATIENTS: Fifty-five patients  undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Simultaneous  blood samples were collected from an indwelling arterial line and a catheter for  determination of blood gases. Standard accepted formulas were utilized to measure a  new oxygenation index: PaO(2)/fraction of inspired oxygen (FIO(2)) x mean airway  pressure (Paw). The standard formulas used were the oxygenation ratio  (PaO(2)/FIO(2)), PaO(2)/alveolar partial oxygen pressure (PAO(2)), alveolar-arterial  oxygen tension gradient (P[A-a]O(2)), and intrapulmonary shunt (venous admixture  [Qsp/Qt]). There were significant negative (p {\textless} 0.05) correlations between the  PaO(2)/(FIO(2) x Paw) and Qsp/Qt (r = - 0.85), between the PaO(2)/FIO(2) and Qsp/Qt  (r = - 0.74), and between the PaO(2)/PAO(2) and Qsp/Qt (r = - 0.71). There was a  significant positive (p {\textless} 0.05) correlation between the P(A-a)O(2) gradient and  Qsp/Qt (r = 0.66). However, the correlation was strongest between the PaO(2)/(FIO(2)  x Paw) and Qsp/Qt. CONCLUSION: In this group of patients, PaO(2)/(FIO(2) x Paw)  might be more reliable than other oxygenation measurements in reflecting  intrapulmonary shunt.},
