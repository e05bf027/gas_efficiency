## Why does the ABG tibble not join to the larger tibble?

This resembles a problem I had when trying my original split-apply-combine
strategy. It seems that if a dataframe is 'too big', R doesn't like joining
other things on to it.


### Possible solutions

1. **Fix at the source**
   - involves setting up the Metavision filter more effectively. This is 
   probably the most promising
   
2. **Assemble a new table to compute each measure/system**
   - this involves making dataframes relating to CV, resp, etc and using these
   smaller frames to compute with

## Attempt 1

- loaded in patient 02_PG
   - using previously wrangled data (from which the ABG sheet was isolated)
   - and current MV output (without ABG data that David will hopefully add)

- next, attempt to join this to the main data frame
